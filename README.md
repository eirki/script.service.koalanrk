# It's Koala NRK!

Koala NRK is an add-on for Kodi, which adds your NRK watchlist ("My list") into your Kodi library, and updates it regularly. This is done by adding an .htm file for each episode and movie in the watchlist, and configuring Kodi to play these files by opening them in a browser. Koala stands for **Ko**di **A**dd to **L**ibrary **A**ddon.

Koala NRK is not affiliated with NRK or Kodi.
